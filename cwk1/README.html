<h1 id="comp1721-coursework-1">COMP1721 Coursework 1</h1>
<p>Everything you need to do in this assignment, aside from editing code, is handled by the Gradle build system. You can run Gradle from the command line or use it from within the IntelliJ IDE if you prefer. If using IntelliJ, please use a recent version of the IDE on your own PC and run the <em>Import Project</em> wizard, specifying the project type as ‘Gradle’.</p>
<p><strong>You do not need to install Gradle yourself</strong>, as we’ve included a ‘Gradle wrapper’ that will download a compatible version of the tool, along with various library dependencies, if required. <strong>This will be very slow the first time that it runs!</strong></p>
<p>On Linux and macOS, run the wrapper with <code>./gradlew</code>. On Windows, it should be possible to run it with <code>gradlew</code>. The commands below assume the use of Linux or macOS. <strong>Please remember that we are unable to support the use of Windows for the practical work in this module</strong>, and certain aspects of the workflow - such as preparing files for submission - will definitely <em>not</em> work on Windows.</p>
<p>The different coursework artifacts are organised into separate projects. You can list these projects with <code>./gradlew projects</code>. The project name needs to be included when running tasks within a specific project.</p>
<h2 id="tests-syle-checking">Tests &amp; Syle Checking</h2>
<p>To run all the unit tests, recompiling code where necessary, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:test</code></pre>
<p>To run only the tests for the basic solution, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:test --tests Basic</code></pre>
<p>Substitute <code>Full</code> for <code>Basic</code> in the above command to run only the tests for the full solution.</p>
<p>Tests and their status (PASSED or FAILED) are listed in the terminal. A <strong>test report</strong> is also generated in HTML, containing detailed information about the tests and any failures that have occurred. You can access this by pointing your browser at <code>core/build/reports/tests/test/index.html</code>. We suggest you keep this page open in a browser tab, refreshing it as necessary, so that you always have full information available on test results.</p>
<p>Note that Gradle won’t normally rerun tests if they have all passed, unless you’ve changed something in your code. You can force it to recompile everything and rerun the tests using</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:test --rerun-tasks</code></pre>
<p>To check coding style for <code>WeatherRecord</code> and <code>WeatherDataset</code>, do</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:checkstyleMain</code></pre>
<p>If there are any style violations, you’ll see a count reported in the terminal window. A full report on the violations can be viewed by pointing your browser at <code>core/build/reports/checkstyle/main.html</code>. Note that style checking is not exhaustive and we may still penalise you on style grounds even if no violations are reported here. As with unit tests, Gradle normally won’t rerun the style check unless you change something in your code.</p>
<p>You can check coding style <em>and</em> run tests in one go with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :core:check</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-analysis-application">The Analysis Application</h2>
<p>You can check coding style for this application with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :analysis:check</code></pre>
<p>You can run the application on the provided data file like this:</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :analysis:run --args ../datafiles/leeds.csv</code></pre>
<p>You can create a redistributable version of the application with</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew :analysis:distZip</code></pre>
<p>This creates a Zip archive <code>analysis.zip</code>, in <code>analysis/build/distributions</code>. This Zip archive contains the compiled code for the core class library and application, bundled into a pair of JAR files, plus a shell script and batch file that can be used to run the program on Linux, macOS or Windows.</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up">Cleaning Up</h2>
<p>To remove all files generated by the build process, use</p>
<pre><code>./gradlew clean</code></pre>
